                                                    DATA TYPES:
data-types
**********
data-type is used to validate the data before going to store in a variable
data-types are divided into 2 types
1.	primitive data-type
2. 	user defined data-type
primitive data-type
*******************
we have 8 primitive data types exist in java

//integer types - byte, short,int, long
1. byte   : byte  a=  100; // 1-byte
2. short  : short b = 2000; // 2-bytes
3. int    : int   c = 120000; // 4- bytes
4. long   : long  e = 67890678; // 8 -Bytes

// Floating Points
5. float  : float d= 23.00f; //stores 6 decimal digits - 4bytes
6. double : double f = 5678902.12d; //stores 16 digits after decimal numbers - 8bytes

// Boolean Types
7. boolean: boolean h = true; // 1 bit - Yes/No OR True/False or on/off

//characters
8. char   : char  g = 'A'; // 2 bytes -single letter

   {     
        System.out.println(a);
        System.out.println(b);
        System.out.println(c);
        System.out.println(d);
        System.out.println(e);
        System.out.println(f);
        System.out.println(g);
        System.out.println(h);
}
user-defined data type
**********************
//String,class,object,interface,Array        
//String - it won't have any length
{
        String myName = "Deekshitha";
        String myJobRole = "Java Developer";
        String companyName = "Delloite";
        System.out.println(myName);
        System.out.println(myJobRole);
        System.out.println(companyName);
}


//Class 
It is a Logical Entity and it's a blue print of an object 

example : Plan is required to construct the house . So here the plan is the class. 


//Object : 
Its a Physical entity  which represents the represents real-life entities
A typical Java program creates many objects, which as you know, interact by invoking methods. 
An object consists of : 
1. state     : It represents attributes and properties of an object. 
2. behaviour : It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object with other objects.
3. Identity. : It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.

example : Plan is required to construct the house . So here the house is the object which we can see. 
      Phone, laptop.pen ,pencil are called objects
